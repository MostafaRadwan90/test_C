<H1>Clown Runs Amok</H1>
<P>In a surprising development today, Clown of the Year
Toby O’Dell-Gonzalez went on a rampage through the
Hideyoshi Circus, spraying at least 17 elephants with
whipped cream.</P>
<H2>Echoes Earlier Incident</H2>
<P>Highly placed sources within the circus confirm that
this is not the first time the famed performer has
committed such an act. “Toby just kind of has a thing
about dairy products,” said one of the co-owners of the
circus.</P>
